### Objective
The primary objective of this initiative is to automate the manual extraction of data lineage for key attributes from Informatica PowerCenter ETL jobs. By leveraging exported XML files stored in Snowflake tables or AWS S3, and utilizing AI-powered services such as Snowflake Cortex or Amazon Bedrock, we aim to streamline the process of identifying and ingesting lineage information into IBM InfoSphere Information Governance Catalog (IGC). This will reduce human effort, minimize errors, and enable scalable, repeatable lineage management across applications.

### Plan Description
The plan involves exporting Informatica PowerCenter ETL workflows and mappings as XML files, storing them in a centralized data repository (Snowflake or AWS S3), and applying AI models from Snowflake Cortex (for natural language processing and structured data extraction) or Amazon Bedrock (for generative AI capabilities) to parse the XML content. The AI will identify key lineage elements, such as source-to-target mappings, transformations, and dependencies for critical attributes. Extracted lineage data will then be formatted and ingested into IGC via automated pipelines. This approach replaces manual review and documentation with an AI-driven workflow, ensuring consistency and efficiency while integrating with existing ETL ecosystems.

### Action Plan
1. **Assess Current State**: Review existing Informatica ETL jobs, identify key attributes for lineage tracking, and evaluate XML export formats.
2. **Set Up Data Storage**: Export XML files from PowerCenter and load them into Snowflake tables or AWS S3 buckets for secure, accessible storage.
3. **Select and Configure AI Service**: Choose between Snowflake Cortex or Amazon Bedrock based on infrastructure alignment (e.g., Cortex for Snowflake-native integration), and configure prompts or models for XML parsing.
4. **Develop Extraction Logic**: Build AI-based scripts or functions to process XML files, extract lineage metadata (e.g., sources, targets, transformations), and validate outputs.
5. **Integrate with IGC**: Create automated ingestion pipelines to push extracted lineage data into IGC, including error handling and logging.
6. **Test and Validate**: Perform end-to-end testing with sample ETL jobs, compare AI-extracted lineage against manual results, and refine as needed.
7. **Deploy and Monitor**: Roll out the automated solution in production, establish monitoring for performance and accuracy, and train teams on usage.

### Benefits
- **Efficiency Gains**: Reduces manual effort from hours/days per ETL job to minutes, freeing resources for higher-value tasks.
- **Accuracy and Consistency**: AI minimizes human errors in lineage extraction, ensuring reliable metadata in IGC for compliance and auditing.
- **Scalability**: Handles growing volumes of ETL jobs without proportional increases in effort, supporting enterprise-wide data governance.
- **Cost Savings**: Lowers operational costs by automating repetitive work and leveraging cloud-native AI services with pay-as-you-go pricing.
- **Improved Data Governance**: Enables faster insights into data flows, enhancing traceability, impact analysis, and regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- **Integration Flexibility**: Works seamlessly with existing tools like Snowflake or AWS, allowing easy adaptation to hybrid environments.

### Activities with Estimated Time Allowances (ETAs)
The following table outlines each activity, responsible party (assumed roles), and ETA based on a team of 3-5 members with moderate experience in Informatica, AI services, and cloud platforms. ETAs are estimates and may vary based on scope, team size, and any unforeseen complexities; they assume sequential execution with some overlap.
